# Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) with Azure Key Vault

This repository provides a step-by-step demo of the Confluent Cloud
feature [Client-Side Field Level Encryption](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/csfle/overview.html).

## Prerequisites

* Confluent Cloud cluster with Advanced Stream Governance package
* For the support python client versions see the
  requirements [here](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/security/encrypt/csfle/client-side.html#confluent-python-client-for-ak)

## Goal

We will produce personal data to Confluent Cloud in the following form

```json
{
  "id": "0",
  "name": "Anna",
  "birthday": "1993-08-01",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-07T19:54:21.884Z"
}
```

However, we set up the corresponding configurations to encrypt the `birthday` field.
We then start a consumer with the corresponding configurations to decrypt the field again.

To have a realistic scenario, we do not produce and consume via the CLI but develop a
producer and consumer application with Python.

## Environment

```aiignore shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Azure Key Vault

### Azure App registration

In Azure first create an application.

1. Got to Microsoft Entra ID
2. From the left side menu go to App registrations > New registration > Provide a name for your app and Register

See
this [Quickstart documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

Then navigate to the registered app and create Client credentials. Create a client secret that will be used by the
Python application to access the Key Vault.

Copy the

* secret value (not the secret ID. Copy this value after creating the client secret)
* tenant ID (of the registered app)
* client ID (of the registered app)

### Azure Key Vault

Create a Key Vault and a key. Copy the Key Identifier as displayed below

### Assign a Key Vault access policy in Azure

In the Key Vault, we use Access policies to grant permission for the key to the registered application, see
the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy?tabs=azure-portal).
We provide "All Key Permissions" (in production we recommend following the principle of least privilege).

## Register Schema

We register the schema with setting `PII` to the birthday field and defining the encryption rule

```shell
curl --location '<SR_URL>/subjects/csfle-demo-value/versions' \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <SR_API_KEY>:<SR_API_SECRET>' \ #base encoded
--data '{
    "schemaType": "AVRO",
    "schema": "{  \"name\": \"PersonalData\", \"type\": \"record\", \"namespace\": \"com.csfleExample\", \"fields\": [{\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\"}, {\"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"string\"},{\"name\": \"birthday\", \"type\": \"string\", \"confluent:tags\": [ \"PII\"]},{\"name\": \"timestamp\",\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}]}"
}'
```

## Register Rule

```shell
curl --location '<SR_URL>/subjects/csfle-demo-value/versions' \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <SR_API_KEY>:<SR_API_SECRET>' \ #base encoded
--data '{
    "ruleSet": {
        "domainRules": [
            {
                "name": "encryptPII",
                "kind": "TRANSFORM",
                "type": "ENCRYPT",
                "mode": "WRITEREAD",
                "tags": [
                    "PII"
                ],
                "params": {
                    "encrypt.kek.name": "csfle-demo-kek",
                    "encrypt.kms.key.id": "<AZURE KEY IDENTIFIED>",
                    "encrypt.kms.type": "azure-kms"
                },
                "onFailure": "ERROR,NONE"
            }
        ]
    }
}'
```

We can check that everything is registered correctly by either executing

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url '<SR_URL>/subjects/csfle-demo-value/versions/latest'   \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <SR API Key>:<SR API Secret>' | jq
```

or in the CC UI (the name of schema subject would be csfle-demo)

## Client configuration

We need to adjust the [producer](avro_producer.py)'s and [consumer](avro_consumer.py)'s configuration.

You need to have the following information

* Broker URL
* Kafka API Key
* Kafka API Secret
* Schema Registry URL
* Schema Registry API Key
* Schema Registry API Secret
* Azure Key Identifier (practically the identifier for the KEK that is stored in your KMS)
* Azure Tenant ID
* Azure Client ID
* Azure Client Secret

Update the corresponding global variables in each client.

## Execute

Run the producer

```aiignore python
python avro_producer.py
```

In the logs you should see

```log
PersonalData record b'2' successfully produced to csfle-demo [1] at offset 0
```

Now you can consume the data

```pycon
python avro_consumer.py
```

In the logs you can see

```log
--- Personal Data ---
  ID:        19
  Name:      Anna
  Birthday:  2006-12-12
  Timestamp: 2025-12-12T15:11:42.477591+00:00
---------------------
```

You can simulate a scenario where a client without access to the KEK consumes the sensitive data.
Change the Client Secret string, e.g. add a character at the end, so that authentication fails. 

You will see some errors in the logs, but you will also see the following

```log
--- Personal Data ---
  ID:        2
  Name:      Anna
  Birthday:  yabvlkT//S+QDAXP7idIl3wU3pHR8/2oZZA8ORovepAun1eLORo=
  Timestamp: 2025-12-12T15:11:42.476313+00:00
---------------------
```

Consumers without access to the KEK are not able to read the fields that you have encrypted with CSFLE.
